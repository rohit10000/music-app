# Custom Music-app based on spotify-api's. | [link](https://music-app-6ec69.web.app)

Things I learnt here:

-> User authentication
-> spotify api usage
-> responsive design
-> material ui (icons)
-> react context api (like redux)
-> React hooks functional (useEffect, useState)
-> firebase deployment
